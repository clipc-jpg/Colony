## Colony

Colony is both a small framework revolving around Singularity Containers and a Graphical User Interface that handles most manual steps around Container Usage.
Containerization allows you to take arbitrary software stacks and package them into one entity - in case of Singularity that entity is a regular file. This makes entire analysis workflows portable and installation free. Everything you need is Singularity and the Container file.
Actually using these Containers, however, often requires much more. You need to manage data (including the Containers), learn how to use the software and then find the correct configuration for your use case. That is where the Colony Launcher GUI helps you - it guides your decision making while organizing, learning and applying your workflows.
